## Required Output Structure

1. **Refactor Motivation**  
   - Identify the problems relevant to the stated refactor goal.  
   - Explain why the refactor is beneficial.  
   - Keep the explanation concise and grounded in the provided code.

2. **Refactored Files**  
   - Output only the files that are changed, added, or removed.  
   - Use the format:

     path/to/file.py
     ---  
     ```python
     <refactored contents>
     ```

   - For removed files, replace contents with `<deleted>`.  
   - Do not add any commentary after the files.

- Do not change external behavior unless explicitly allowed.  
- Do not add new dependencies.  
- Keep changes minimal but meaningful.  
- Do not modify or generate tests unless instructed.  
- Prefer direct, explicit improvements over broad redesign.
